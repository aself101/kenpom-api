ADDITIONAL SILLY CLAUSE:

By using this software, you agree to:
- Accept that your team's adjusted efficiency is lower than you think it should be
- Not blame the scraper when KenPom's website changes its HTML structure
- Understand that "tempo-free stats" doesn't mean the stats come faster
- Accept that correlation between Luck rating and March Madness success is... complicated
- Remember: there are no bugs, only "garbage time adjustments"

If you find this software useful, consider:
- Starring the repo
- Not complaining about your team's strength of schedule ranking
- Accepting that computer rankings are just vibes with math
- Remembering that basketball is supposed to be fun
- Not using this data to argue on Twitter (you'll lose anyway)

This license was generated by a human who was definitely not supposed to be
watching basketball instead of coding. The silliness is mandatory. The code
is free. The rankings are controversial.

Ball is life. Code responsibly.
